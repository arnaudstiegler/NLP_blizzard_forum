            "init_post": "I miss vendors. I miss how hard it was to get gear and how it rewarding it felt to finally collect enough currency to buy that one piece of gear you wanted.Do you guys like the loot lottery system that\u2019s in the game right now or would you rather have vendors back?I miss rings having main stats on them.I also miss pvp gear having resilience and giving an edge in pvp. I\u2019m sure a lot of you will say versatility is the same thing and maybe you\u2019re right idk. But pvp doesn\u2019t feel the  best to me right now.It feels to me that the carrot on a stick that was gear is no longer there due to how easy it is to obtain pve gear and how hard it is to obtain the pvp gear you want. I feel like the only grinds in the game right now is AP which feels really bad because you can only do one specific thing to efficently farm it and extremely small rep gains from doing the world quests and the vendor rewards are the only carrot on a stick now.I haven\u2019t bothered hitting exalted for any faction and rep grinds are the worst thing in the game to me and has been bundled with world quests which I cannot seem to force myself to do and seem to loathe. I think I prefer doing group content in a MMO and world quests is a strictly solo thing. I think this is the same reason I hate gearing my alts right now.I can easily get geared out in no time but essences are a time gated grind and most things are locked behind rep walls where the rep you get from doing the quests and zones are limited each day.There\u2019s no alternative path to getting that rep like say running the dungeon in mechagon and getting rep for the rustbolt resistance or do the EP to get ankoan/unshackled rep. It feels like the worst way to time gate progress/rewards.I wish there was pve group content you could do to get rep outside of the boring world quest system.",

Personally I only occasionally RP, more often than not I just write up RP Profiles then never use them, but that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to RP on an RP server.Unfortunately the RP community in general has it\u2019s own set of issues though.There are -multiple- tumblr\u2019s out there, for example, dedicated to just calling out people they don\u2019t like. And people seem to like that they exist.Cliques tend to be worse on these realms as well. There\u2019s tons of cool people but there\u2019s also tons of groupthink. I\u2019ve got hatemail from relatively benign comments I\u2019ve made on the realm forums on two difference occasions on two different realms (not on this character), including someone who tried to get my GM to gkick me. Do note that I\u2019ve been playing for 9 years now and have been actively posting on the forums for a good chunk of that time, so it\u2019s not as if I waltzed in last month and pissed off people already, because I can already feel someone typing up \u201cwell maybe it\u2019s you\u201d. I\u2019ve just had bad experiences dipping into the niche group that browses RP realm forums.Then there\u2019s the bizarre fascination with kink guilds on Moon Guard, even outside of Goldshire. Cool for those who like it, incredibly offputting for those who don\u2019t.I don\u2019t mean to say the RP Community is bad, I still love it, but it\u2019s not terribly hard to find the crappy people if you dig into it a bit. I don\u2019t know how it is on Twitter.

I even got into the whole RP side of things for a bit, but my home guild is on Thunderlord, and we got busy with raiding.  I had no time for my RP server endeavors.

So I can see that there are bad elements.The twitter community I am sure has it\u2019s flaws as well, but I don\u2019t dig and stopped reading comments. Especially comments on Facebook pages, like they are ran by trolls and advocated by trolls.I just like that everyone is in the actual world of Azeroth and share their screenshots of them enjoying the game, however they like to enjoy it.I spend alot of my time just adventuring and flying around collecting transmogs, mounts, toys, etc. etc. I spent one night on a boat by myself just dancing on a boat in swamp of sorrows, might have had a few drinks.

Basically, there needs to be nothing inside of the shapes you make. Start near the edges and see if there are any already mostly done. Start clearing out around there by swapping the orbs away.

I can usually get a few of them, but I can never get the whole thing. It reminds me of this mini game in \u201cPsychonauts\u201d where you have to slap cardboard enemies as they pop up, but it\u2019s one of the most widely reviled ones because the timing is incredibly tight and you have to move around to properly do it adding layers of tedium.",

It\u2019s super niche and requires to many targets to be viable in most cases, but i\u2019d be careful about throwing rocks while asking for THEM of all classes to be nerfed.The REAL classes that need buffs are the casters.    ZERO casters have a role in Mythic plus, except MAYBE elemental shamans and that\u2019s more because of their utility (stun totem and earth elemental) and short cd interrupt than anything else.Unless they break the mold entirely and give casters a short cd interrupt and more utility, (which will break raid balance) the only solution is to heavily buff our burst aoe damage.     Cast timers do not work in dungeons where melee can kill massive groups of trash in seconds.",

I was a ret pally in vanilla (yes I got laughed out the door in raids) and a ret pally in bc. Even though for most pve my class was garbage I was still invited to raids because I brought something no other class could bring (blessing).You had incentive to play classes other than min/max. Shamans had totems and even though elemental was garbage for pve because you would go oom quickly there was still incentive to invite them because they had something no other class had, same thing with a vanilla balance druid.  Now it doesn\u2019t matter. There isn\u2019t much incentive to bring a balance druid because you gotta have one or any other class. It\u2019s all become a bland boring mess in class design.That\u2019s just my opinion though. Another thing is in vanilla I remember that I wasn\u2019t playing a \u201cretribution paladin\u201d I was playing a paladin that went deep into retribution. If I needed to tank you could just equip sword and board and go do the dungeon. (You\u2019re not raiding with a paladin because no taunt)",

There are downsides to playing Ret in PVE content, so while we shine in some situations we are not OP, and it would be very unfortunate if this misconception resulted in a nerf.  Outside of cooldowns our sustained damage is quite low compared to other melee dps specs, we also have low cleave damage (not to be confused with aoe damage).  If I did not have an active guild to do activities with, I would not make it into many mythic plus runs, because again outside of Reaping there isn\u2019t much reason to bring a Ret over a DH or Rogue.  Inside BoD, the only fight that Ret has a clear DPS advantage is Opulence, but that is just the nature of the gems and which gem you personally are assigned to.

But, to other players, you may appear to be a nightelf hunter.   So long you see on your screen you being a troll hunter, and the players on your side of the fight are of the horde on your screen, everything is fine.

            "init_post": "Over in the classic forums, a debate over streamers has been raging as to how they will affect the classic experience. Head over and join us if you wish What does general chat think of Streamer\u2019s like Asmongold and others trashing BFA while promoting classic? Instead of simply promoting classic, they are trying to tear down retail as well. They are constantly talking about how Blizzard ruined WoW, BFA is garbage, etc. It is a bit baffling. Blizzard has chosen these people to market classic by streaming the beta, yet these people are trashing Blizzard\u2019s other part of WOW- Retail. You usually don\u2019t see this, as in ever, from someone given privileges to market a company\u2019s product. It seems to be incredibly detrimental to the perception of BFA. Since Blizzard is hoping people will try out both. BFA players give classic a whirl and some classic return players give BFA  a whirl, I am puzzled by the streamer privilege here. Also puzzled as to why they can\u2019t simply leave BFA alone and hype up classic. I am all for classic, but there\u2019s no reason to trash on retail, I have fun flying around on a 110 rogue built for speed.I am planning on playing classic, and I have played a bit of retail, but I don\u2019t think there needs to be a war from either side. If people enjoy one, they can enjoy that without trashing the other side.What do you guys think of this and the general streamer attitudes?",

I wanna play an MMORPG again and BFA just isnt that.  From ther removal of server and guild community to the removal of quirky flare classes and professions used to have.  Its ok if you have to work for gear.  It\u2019s a good thing to not have everything handed to you with 0 effort.  That is something retail had lost and Classic has.I am glad streamers are trashing retail.  Maybe ther devs will listen and give us an MMORPG to play again.",

There are some very vehement streamer defenders who will do so.",

They knew some of the people they were giving the beta\u2019s too (i.e. Asmongold &amp; company) didn\u2019t look favorably at the current iteration of the game. They were crossing their fingers that the BFA trash-talking would be minimal, and it has been quite honestly.I\u2019ve only started watching Streams since beta was being aired on Twitch and while you get the occasional \u201cBFA is garbage\u201d comment, it\u2019s largely a focus on the fun their having with Classic. It\u2019s not nearly as toxic as OP makes it out to be.",

It\u2019s no different from the guilds I\u2019ve had to deal with in the past and a streamer isn\u2019t going to make the situation any different in my eyes.",

Nor did they cause the servers to crash by hosting events. Nor would they have a report system to abuse.Also, there will still be those guilds, now you add in one guy that is like 3-4 of those guilds in numbers and suddenly you have toxicity everywhere.",

                "And how is that going to negatively affect the game? That\u2019s been happening for years before lfg was a thing?Back then the community was nice enough to help each other guide.",

I played vanilla 15 years ago, and my opinion is my own. I\u2019ll share it, yeah. But not going to try and bash the current game to bring up \u201cvanilla 2.0\u201d with my 5 million subscribers.IDK, it\u2019s all stupid and petty to me./moo",

I don\u2019t watch him stream the game I just watch his youtube videos.",
                "I don\u2019t think the community that Vanilla had will necessarily be replicated in Classic. We\u2019re talking different generations of players now and the internet in general is much more toxic now than it was back then.",

When I was first starting out in late 2004, there was a few guys in a guild (can\u2019t remember guild name) that were just a$$holes, ninjas. They were reported over and over, and they managed to fool quite a few people. Blizz eventually caught them messing with code via mods or something\u2026and perma banned them.It can be done, and will be.",
                "I don\u2019t really watch streamers in general, so I don\u2019t have much of an opinion on this.  Regarding Blizzard\u2019s stance on this, Classic and BfA both require an active subscription.  They still come out ahead regardless of which game people actually play.An important thing to remember about the streamer hype is it\u2019s them comparing Classic leveling to BfA endgame.  It\u2019s an inherently flawed comparison, and I can\u2019t help but think some details are going to be smoothed over or skipped.  As an example, I can\u2019t imagine anyone presenting an Uldaman run in a legitimately positive light.  The big thing though is they\u2019re doing content that a person will only do once or twice and comparing it to content intended to be done repeatedly.  I doubt anyone\u2019s going to stream farming Scholo runs for their tier hat for the nth time.",
                "Is it hard to believe some streamers just dont like BFA? Im going to be trying classic because BFA hasnt been a good experience, and i personally feel its one of their bottom 2 expansions.I fail to connect with streamers, so i couldnt care less if they hate classic or hate BFA - they have opinions and are pandering to a crowd in hopes people will donate/subscribe to them.Bottom line, its freedom of speech.",

I don\u2019t buy their hype or disgust.I can form my own opinion (good or bad) about the game.While BFA has its issues, Classic had it\u2019s fair share too.Part of me thinks later in the expansion, those same people praising Classic and bashing BFA will be bashing Classic and praising BFA.",
                "I don\u2019t think \" trashing \" would be the correct word.Harsh criticism would be a better fit, You have to think and take into account that someone like asmon has spent nearly most of their life playing retail world of Warcraft. As bad as his words do sound it is because he loves the game and wants it to be good. We can judge him from his harsh words and then spin that into something against him or we can take a step back and think why is he being so harsh about it.I personally don\u2019t really care if someone has an opinion or not.",

                "I think Streamers in general, are looking out for A#1, themselves.Now, there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that, excepting that they don\u2019t iterate or even reiterate that reality when it comes to speaking to their viewers.I used to watch this one streamer for The Division.  He would post vids on strats, builds and on various gameplay items, vendor resets, etc.  That game had a rough go of it in the beginning and actually had a \u2018summit\u2019 of Developers and Gamers/Streamers go out to Sweden to talk with Ubisoft about their game.This streamer was one of those folks and I believe he was even invited back a second time for some discussion on ongoing issues.  Turns out in the end, this guy just gravitated to another game.  No problem really, his prerogative, but, the investment that the COMPANY put into him, forget the viewers of his channel, that UBISOFT invested into him to help make their product better, and he just left it.  Now, I have no issue with his personal decision there, but as to his viewers and the relationship towards the Game and the company itself, that was left high and dry.So, unless this guy picks up a game that I enjoy or whatever, I have no reason to watch his channel anymore.  That\u2019s the point.  Streamers can go where the winds of their whims blow them, but their viewers typically came to them via a specific product, and when that is gone, the streamer has some considerations to be made.Now, I\u2019m old, I\u2019m not like you young cats who are all into the streaming aspect of gaming.  It serves a very limited purpose to me and beyond that limited purpose, streamers don\u2019t have any place of value in my life.  They\u2019re not my friend.  If I stop viewing their channel they\u2019re not going to come looking for me and trying to find out why I specifically don\u2019t care to watch\u2026  So, recognize the purpose they serve and that their loyalties aren\u2019t to YOU and down the road maybe they too can start being more than mouthpieces yay or nay for a given product.",

Obviously some gameplay elements because a game like the Witcher wouldn\u2019t make sense if it was only cutscenes.I commented congratulating him. Like, THAT takes time lol. To play through the entire Witcher 2 campaign and record it? The way he did it, I would give the kid $20 bucks for that lol.Oh jesus lmao god that\u2019s why I love South Park.

A sneezing panda, or say if i don\u2019t know my cat was meowing in a comical way.If i get like 5 million views do i deserve a check for $500k because i taped my cat on my phone? So I agree with the Youtube algorithm idea, but sadly we can\u2019t control that.My view on tubers is on the level of the Kardashians and why most people hate them and their ratings did go down, even though the fact they lasted more than 1 season shows our society lol.But the whole famous for being famous cliche and making a awful \u201creality\u201d show that takes 30 days to film and you make $10 million a year is flat out pathetic. But that\u2019s become my main issue with youtube the past few years.I love Kevin smith and at least when Kevin does fatman beyond, he talks for 90 mins. Interacts with fans, does a Q and A. Gives opinions. Kevin isn\u2019t making millions from going to a bar every Friday night talking with fans.Same as Jay Mewes when he does facebook live and fortnite. Jay literally just asks people\u2019s gamertags, sends invites, plays. Win or lose Jay just has fun. I\u2019ve NEVER seen him ask for a like, a donation or yell at a fan.",

That means more active people wanting to engage intheir stream if the product is worth whileBut BfA is in such a bad state that even they cant lie to themselves enough to pass this mess off as anything positive",
                "and yet lol i keep reading things like this but have yet to see any examples. I\u2019ve had a ton of fun in BFA. I honestly don\u2019t see what the main complaints are.",

Island expeditions are fine with me, pushing mythic 10 or 11 keys.We\u2019re still working on heroic mekka then eventually Jaina. I mean i honestly don\u2019t know what issues people have?

                "which is why?",

                "Personally speaking, i\u2019m not a fan of many Youtubers and/or Streamers. Streamers especially since their really just the video game equivalent of Celebs, and just as annoying, though, chances for more Kayne West and Kim Kardashin style crap to happen is more likely.You do have some good YouTubers and Streamers here and there that stand out from the norm. One example i can think off the top of my head for Video Games Journalism on YouTube is Jim Sterling. Granted his views are not for everybody (biased wasn\u2019t the correct word, i don\u2019t think) and he does make a mistake here and there\u2026 and have a bit of an ego going on, and somewhat angry, But he is for the most part, very informative to those who are interested in Video game journalism and even sometimes, off topic ones. He isn\u2019t the only one obviously. There is more, but i will be here all day trying to list them all.Going back to Songs for a minute, While i don\u2019t really listen much of Rap/Hip Hop these days due to being repetitive in topics in their songs, Eminem comes to mind as a good example of how to stand out from the norm though topic-wise in their songs. It also helps that he\u2019s good to begin with imo.Really, if we look at Steamers/Youtubers and Songs at the base and break this down to simple math, I\u2019m not against them making money\u2026 i\u2019m against them in terms of if i don\u2019t like them if their crap to begin with or being plain buttheads about their fame and etc.",
                "why do i know the name jim sterling?  Yeah i mean Eminem is like a weird thing to debate. When he arrived, i enjoyed the comedy aspect of it. Then time passes and some songs are like uhh look dude when your daughter is older does she really need to hear songs about you murdering her mother and raping her grandmother lol?He\u2019s good in a sense to rhyme words, and i respect unlike 98% of his audience he actually has a vocabulary that isn\u2019t 2nd grade broken English. But also i\u2019ve always said i think entertainers in general are vastly overpaid.But when it comes to tubers and twitch, it\u2019s just so much non creative and lazy. At least writing a song, getting it on the radio, doing it live in front of 10k people, that\u2019s work, signing autographs etc.I mean I\u2019m at home in my room typing this to you on my pc. I don\u2019t feel like i need to make money for it lol. I\u2019ll never fully support what celebs make. But at least some actors like keanu reeves is an awesome human being doing countless charity and doing his own stunts in john wick.So i guess for every keanu you have a jersey shore star or honey boo boo trash. Same as youtube. I watch this kid matt walsh. He\u2019s in the military. Does videos. What to expect entering boot camp. What not to say to drill sergeant\u2019s.I respect that because he has an active career and does that videos to help people who want to enlist.

Can look up that blue post from like a month ago.Personally I\u2019m looking forward to classic just to hear all the people that are hyping it up to fall flat on their face excluding the old timers that were there for vanilla and the hardcore raiders planning on clearing naxx and such.But most of all I look forward to making peoples experience of leveling a nightmare as I didn\u2019t get to experience much of the roguecraft days back in vanilla but I will this time around.

Even Venruki who was pretty hellbent on Classic not being good a good experience overall changed his tune about it.At the end of the day people play good games.

                "Yeah I agree, to me blizzard has catered too much to the casual. It needs to be scaled back to how it was or just tweak/tune it.I\u2019d get rid of lfr, titanforging, warforging isn\u2019t as big an issue although killing heroic garrosh 65 x to see your weapon warforge once the last week before the next expansion sucks.The free basically effortless loot you get just for logging in like that post I just posted above. The casual player base has it great but they want end game loot for doing casual meaningless content like that guy and his world quests.I really do agree if you\u2019re a casual player and the only content you do is normal and heroic raids you don\u2019t deserve getting mythic ilvl gear. If you want to acquire that gear then get good, find a guild or a raid group of competent players to work together to acquire it. You don\u2019t deserve 425 pieces for doing anything below mythic raids in my book.I don\u2019t mind how the mythic + system turned out but If they really want another option other than raiding then they should scale gear higher but you\u2019d have to be doing like +20-25 keys to have a chance at a mythic ilvl piece in my opinion.I did over 1600 mythic + dungeons the first 6 months of legion, we did mythic nighthold. The only upgrades I got from that raid were trinkets/tier. That shouldn\u2019t happen.Also if they were to keep titanforging a simple change that would be meaningful is to cap it. Lfr caps at normal base, normal to heroic base and heroic to mythic base but anything below mythic can\u2019t titanforge or warforge past the next base ilvl.",
                "The difference for me when it comes to Star Wars is I take it to the games. All EA had to do to make a successful Battlefront game was introduce the exact same systems with some added flair from Battlefront 2 on Playstation. Have amazing space battles that players saw in the movies and be able to reenact with their favorite ships and be a part of their favorite battles.What did they do?Add a ton of monetization with loot boxes with no space combat. Something nobody asked for.You could also look at another game that was originally going off the deep end with how much they changed the original reason people picked up their game. That being Resident Evil. They started adding in more action to the game rather than trying to create a scary experience of what it would be like to fight against hordes of zombies.But when they released Resident Evil 7 and returned to form, the game blew up. And people loved it again.The point I\u2019m making is when people decide to get \u201ccute\u201d and want to try and change things up drastically that alter the original core ideology of what brought people to it to begin with, you begin to lose people.AAA companies have been losing people due to their own greed. Which now there\u2019s even a bill talking about banning loot boxes in games meant to be played by minors seeing that it\u2019s pretty much gambling. And other companies that drift away from what made their franchise great are also losing people.Am I saying that games can never evolve and change? Hell no. Not my stance at all. But when you ignore \u201cwhy\u201d people played your game to begin with when making a new installment, you just lose people.",

                "The only other game that I can play outside of wow, is the division (1). The reasons I don\u2019t have the second one is I won\u2019t pay $60 or more freaking dollars on a game, secondly\u2026I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s filled with toxic kids. Some of the pvp videos are cringe.",
                "i dunno. The casual vs hardcore debate has been around for years. It\u2019s like i get you don\u2019t want someone to be say 425 like you if you\u2019re doing mythic jaina but also when wow hit 15 years ago, at 22 my life was VERY different then now at 37.I\u2019m honestly only typing this because I\u2019m off from work for a few weeks. I no longer have the time for a Wow day of sitting down for 8-10 hours leveling or raiding.We raid each sat and sun from 9-11. Before i was in guilds that would raid like 3-4 nights for 3-4 hours. I don\u2019t have it in me now raid as a part time job. But also like wtf my mistweaver alt is 390. I am TRYING to get to 400. Last Sunday i was literally in 10 different pugs for Heroic Bod. TEN!Never made it past Grong. Like the average person can\u2019t even do simple effing mechanics! Lol. And compared to older expansions,this is watered down! I joined a pug tomb of sarg run for transmog because i like the Xeun monk set.How many pugs at 410 still can\u2019t make it past maiden? MAIDEN!!! lol. But the average person i see bashing BGA and it\u2019s content I\u2019m like well besides 400 or 410 how many Heroic Jaina kills do you have? Crucible?Have you cleared mythic jadefire or grong? Because a friend of mine not too long ago was breaking down the stats on mythic for legion then so far in bfa, the majority of the gamers paying for this game are not clearing that content lol.My DH just hit 410 and I\u2019m still trying to get aotc lol",
                "2 is VERY fun, with a ton of content. But yeah you need to join a 4 man squad because solo it\u2019s very boring",
                "Yeah were currently working on jaina, I can also understand that you have a life/work and such but if you can\u2019t put in the time/effort to find either a decent raiding group or guild then I still don\u2019t think you deserve getting the same rewards to those that do.It\u2019s not hard to gear, legion for example I was fully mythic geared on my main. I ended up making a warrior alt cause they were hella op and fun to play. I played it for a maximum of a month, it surpassed my mains gear in 3 weeks and it was already out dpsing it also prior to outgearing it.I was trying to think of a way to compare it to a console game where you\u2019re only good enough to do the easy/normal difficulties but you want to get awarded for the hard difficulty. Well either get good or put more time into it like those that have.The gear and casual/hardcore debate relates to a lot of things in life when you think about it. Take a look at the pay gap myth debate between men and women for example.",
                "Well to be honest Bf2 did have a rough start i won\u2019t debate that. However loot boxes never bothered me considering everything in the game could be earned. I still play bf 2 once a week. I love heroes and villains, the new maps, adding obi wan and grevious and the space battles can be a ton of fun.Some maps like jakku look right out of episode 8 and it\u2019s visually awesome in 4k. Re 7 was good and bad because people got used to 3rd, not 1st person, but i did like it.The loot box thing, i mean if it\u2019s cosmetic, that doesn\u2019t bother me, If you want to spend an extra 10 bucks for a new skin, i can\u2019t stop you. It\u2019s your money even if i find it weird lol.But wow classic or bfa or bc or wotlk. It\u2019s still essentially the same mmo. You play a warr and tank or heal as a priest. You level cap then starting joining raids or join a guild.Once you\u2019re best in slot or have your tier set, you level an alt or just wait for a new expansion. I\u2019ve seen in every expansion, some guilds eat the content in 2-3 months, then come back 6 months later.A lot of people also play wow daily and hell i take breaks lol. This is why i have an xbox and beating halo wars 2",
                "And personally, I think that\u2019s okay. I think a massive problem with games is that it\u2019s meant to be for everyone to jump in and out. If you don\u2019t have all day to do things, then it\u2019s okay to have a story fleshed out in front of you over the course of multiple weeks to maybe even months. It means that you\u2019ll have a different experience each time you log in, all the while watching your character grow and become strong.",
                "Who cares? Honestly. Why does it affect me what others like? Even if they\u2019re making dissenting comments towards what I like, I don\u2019t really care, nor do I see a reason why others should either. Their opinions upon it aren\u2019t going to magically shut down retail version.",

                "I reached endgame on the first a kazillion times, and doing the same crap over and over is just not fun. It\u2019s not like this game, where the world is bigger and you have tons of choices on how to start.",
                "Thank you. I mean jesus i remember the days of hey guys let\u2019s all get some pizza or taco bell and screw it, make a lan party and play halo 2 from 8 pm until 3 am haha. God how many of us would come over to my house, all had laptops, let\u2019s do some bg\u2019s in burning crusade and AV until 3 am!Even on my days off from work, Friday i grab my check, knock out some bills, pick up my son from school at 230. Ok let\u2019s get our allergy shots, ok then hey new godzilla came out! See that at 4 pm, 2 hour film, plus previews, done at 630. Hey need to stop at walmart get some cat food, laundry soap, let\u2019s grab dinner.Home by 730? Oh yeah Saturday morning i need to be up for work at 6am. That\u2019s an average Friday. Have tuesdays off, i mean who knows, car needs oil change, gotta mow the yard, it\u2019s been raining for 3 weeks lmao. Gotta do some jogging today, hey new game of thrones came out, can\u2019t miss that.This is the most i\u2019ve played in about 3 years lol and only because I just had surgery. That\u2019s why our raid nights are sat sun from 9-11. I mean i could hop on at 5 pm when i get home, but you know, gotta shower, vacuum etc.",
                "Monkenpoo, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here? You seem like a nice person, but you seem to be on some crusade against streamers. You have made a number of threads in the Classic forums recently with what seems to be the intent of turning as much of the player base against them as you can.Seriously, what is your end goal here? What are you hoping to accomplish? What are you trying to accomplish? It seems that your goal is to stir up hate towards a group of people that you obviously have issues with.You have been in the Classic forums stirring up the nest, now you come here trying to do the same. No matter if you like it, or if I like it, streamers are more than likely here to stay and how exactly are they bothering you personally? Because they got in a beta and you didn\u2019t? Because they somehow could get in the game when none of us could that first stress test? You know what, I was a bit annoyed that first stress test also. But here\u2019s the thing, you are directing your hate in the wrong place.It\u2019s just too much in my opinion. It\u2019s like these guys have had to take all the flack because how dare they play a game before some of us get to. They take flack from people like you. It may sound like I\u2019m defending the streamers, I\u2019m not. I could care less if it\u2019s a streamer or a person I meet in a game, to direct hate and try to bring others along with you just isn\u2019t cool when these people aren\u2019t doing a single thing to you personally.",
                "I do agree that blindly following some idiot streamer isn\u2019t a great way to judge a game. When ever I watch a streamer it\u2019s usually just to chill or if It\u2019s a game I\u2019m interested in I watch the actual game play and not the streamer.",
                "The problem with loot boxes is that the developers always make sure that if you want to earn it, you have to pretty much go through a rough experience. You can farm for what was it? 40-80 hours to unlock vader or something like that? Or, you could just pay me 80 bucks. I can never really agree with systems like that. They\u2019re not even DLC. Companies expect me and many others to not only buy their game, but spend additional money on things that should be unlocked through gameplay.For instances like the game I currently play, Monster Hunter: World, the upcoming pack that they\u2019re adding is called Iceborne gives me several new zones, new monsters to fight, new mechanics to my weapons, new armor and weapons ect. ect. Which I can accept. They gave me a quality product and are making a more to add on to the game? I open up my wallet. At least that\u2019s my philosophy when picking up games.But back to WoW, Vanilla is almost polar opposite of what BFA is. In pretty much every aspect. For me to go over everything would be a massive post that might as well be a thread on its own. But I think of BFA as a game that\u2019s worried way too much about the destination. While Vanilla was more concerned about the journey.",
                "Also hi Haavi! I see you typing there ^.^",
                "and it is a hard balance of work/life and raiding. Also having a guild that we\u2019re all casual but very good players. But asking most people to raid 4 nights a week is a lot. Considering most of us are 2 nights we\u2019re doing fantastic imo.But also my point was, in all fairness how like, well dumb the average person is lol. Like these heroic bod fights are NOT hard, and again after doing last sunday 10 failed pugs in a row who can\u2019t get a specter on grong and pick up an orb, i mean wtf?The thing better about console games is when i get home, if i have 10 mins or an hour i can pop in red dead 2 and just play. I\u2019m not worrying about time or gear score or looking up fights.But i also don\u2019t have to rely on 15 other people to not be idiots.People tend to forget in classic wow. Raids were 40 man! I can\u2019t get 12 people to kill a dam ape",
                "I raid 2 nights 8 hrs a week, my work life is about to change but I don\u2019t see an issue finding another guild if need be to still clear end game content.There are incompetent players in my guild also but if that\u2019s an issue it sounds more like bad leadership holding onto players that aren\u2019t carrying their own weight or not enough of a bench or effort in recruiting so you have reliable people available.",
                "Played both games lol yeah right there barely people playing those vs WoW.",
                "yeah i forgot the exact time for vader. but i bought the game day 1, i bought him within a week lol and i wasn\u2019t playing 5 hours a day. But also it becomes like wow. Ok we have a shooter. Within the first 3 weeks i unlocked every chaarcter, every skin, every map.I\u2019m bored. I mean for me it took months to unlock every character and i was fine with that and i wasn\u2019t playing daily. It\u2019s dam sure a weird scale. I mean if YOU want to spend 100 bucks and unlock the cast, you can. I won\u2019t.and i just beat MHW because i love the witcher, awesome seeing geralt in mh. But even mh, that game is vastly different than a year ago. I will be fine with jumping into their new dlc.But in the sense the game was very limited. Very few zones, the weapons were similar and grinding the same bosses over and over again for cosmetic gear. I love my dragoon set, but i felt the same as playing wow for the most part.Overall what i see different in classic for now is just time. Classic or bfa. One is 60, one is 120. You still need to hit cap and gear up and do it with a guild. Classic didn\u2019t have WQ, it was WAY harder to make gold in classic lol and god pvp was very awful.It\u2019s why i still hate rogues to this day as someone who mained a warlock",
                "Yeah over the years I\u2019ve learned that depending on other people is a bad choice and usually overcompensate to try and fill in the gap but that\u2019s not really possible. If you want to clear end game content you need to have a group of people that can carry their own weight at minimum.That\u2019s why there\u2019s usually an average pull # per boss but nobodies the same when it comes to learning. Some/most may need more pulls to fully understand a fight.",
                "Then don\u2019t play with them.Problem solved. Why the need to constantly be making this a much bigger issue than it really is?",
                "i mean i don\u2019t think 4 hours is too bad, depending on schedule. My bad players just comes down to pugging the nights we don\u2019t raid. We have a very solid group and keep adding new people.But it is hard balance new players this late into the expansion and being strict. Myself or my gm knows life happens and some nights we have 15 on, some nights we need to pug 3 or 4.At this point i love the guild for the social aspect. Very good down to earth people who don\u2019t have an elitist mentality",
                "My guildies are lazy and the exact opposite of elitist. I think the only reason we ever clear content anymore is because of the leadership we have. But seriously trying to get people to get to a certain artifact level or even bother doing their weekly mythic + when it mattered for progression was like pulling teeth.",
                "Time affects a lot of things. For me with MHW the game is different, but they didn\u2019t change the core ideology of why people picked it up and farmed those bosses to begin with. I eagerly await for them to release Iceborne because I know it will be a continuation of that while at the same time updating pretty much everything.Right now there\u2019s a massive difference between Classic and BFA. And like I said there\u2019s a laundry list of things that would just be way too much to compare. But the ideology of Classic is to create a world that people would want not only be a part of, but to find allies and interact with one another to ensure a much easier time for success.BFA is more about the single player experience. Most of the game you can do while on your own and without having to communicate with anyone. And to make matters even worse with changes like CRZ/Phasing/Warmode most of the people that you do run into, you\u2019ll more than likely never see again.Hence why I say that BFA is more fixated on you getting to the destination with the least amount of resistance possible. While Classic wants you to go on a journey that has ups and downs but it\u2019s the community that bands together to take down difficult tasks. All the while having RPG elements. Like for me I have ammo, the dead zone and I had to feed my pet to keep him happy. Which I personally enjoy.",
                "yeah at the end of legion my now gm quit and asked me to come with him because he was leading every run in legion and got all content except mythic done and the former gm became an issue so he decided to make his own guild.Considering we\u2019re a little over a year old what we have done is amazing. We have good people, but you can tell some need a lot of umm training lol. I may even go get aotc with a pug to be honest",
                "I\u2019ve been in a few top 50 guilds over the years and it\u2019s no fun, makes the game feel like a chore/work. I\u2019m not saying they need to spend all day farming for ap/gear or anything but put in the minimal amount of effort to better themselves so it makes the rest of your groups jobs easier.",
                "im glad to see you have that type of experience, but i\u2019ve had that a lot in bfa. I think overall many gamers have become some jaded, even myself after years of toxic people. This applies to not just wow but people who play overwatch or halo or call of duty.Remember when a community is smaller i feel like people stick together and help each other. But when a player base goes from 1 million to 10, you have a chance at meeting 9 million more awful people.Anything we do online has a chance of becoming toxic, but that\u2019s human nature. Hell i have friends who won\u2019t see movies anymore in theaters lol",
                "Tbh I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be much of a community and more forced cooperation. It won\u2019t be anywhere near how it was in vanilla but you may have more of a community with friends/guildies you already know than with others.Only reason I say that is cause people that were there for vanilla, their mentality has changed quite a bit over the years and the new generation of players is quite different also.",
                "this guy in our guild is a mistweaver and he took the summer off for work. Man the stories he has from being in a streaming guild. yeah no for me lol. He flat out admitted he hated it and it took all the joy from the game. He felt 1000 times better opening a restaurant and stopping streaming.He mentioned guilds like method and others and i forgot what he was in but he wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. I raid because i enjoy it, not because i feel like it\u2019s going to work",
                "Yeah, I\u2019ve gotten a bit burned out due to some players in guild that are lacking that have hung around for quite some time but unless you have another option you can\u2019t exactly replace them either.Been recovering from a few tanks quitting and some not so good ones. But I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get jaina at some point.",
                "well yeah. I mean god i hate to sound this way but look at the age gap. Sorry but at 22 i wasn\u2019t entitled lol. Someone now at 18 playing wow is WAY different then someone playing wow when i was 18.Hell i didn\u2019t have youtube or twitch to beg for money lol. I had to work and pay for my subscription and hope on my days off i could get some raiding in",
                "Yeah I was 14 when wow came out, I\u2019ve probably taken off a year of gametime from it. But I would say my mentality especially when interacting with people online has changed quite a lot. I\u2019ve gotten more blunt/straight forward and kind of a butt. But mostly towards inconsiderate people.I know it\u2019s a game but if people like your self only has an hour to play it\u2019s pretty inconsiderate at least to me to wipe a group over and over for example.",
                "i dealt with that yesterday. Like we were doing heroic mekka. By now EVERYONE knows you NEED a mic. You HAVE to call stuff out. So our main tank and 1 dps didn\u2019t have a mic or wouldn\u2019t talk. Now I\u2019m getting aggervated. Like look we\u2019re all in this guild, most of us are friends, don\u2019t sit there and expect 12 other people to cater to you because you want to be anti social.Then dps was an issue. Like I\u2019m a Dh. Check any wow parse. We are NOT top damage. If i am top damage every pull, there is an issue. Some people doing 7 or 8 k dps. Like look if you\u2019re not pulling 10k, then gtfo. I\u2019m sorry i shouldn\u2019t need to spend 35 minutes carrying you because you don\u2019t know your character.I join a pug. If you don\u2019t know the effing mechanics then don\u2019t join a heroic! You don\u2019t know Grong or Jadefire then get out.",
                "Yeah I\u2019ve found pugging somtimes better than my core raid. But if they\u2019re raiding mythic I would get bored of running heroic.",
                "I have had those types of interactions in live as well, but it\u2019s much more rare and not something that happens very often. The best you can hope for is to find a guild with nice people to interact with.But out in the world, and in dungeons, those interactions are very rare. Whenever I enter a dungeon or LFR for example, I always say hi when entering. Always. Most times some do say hello back, but that\u2019s the end of any conversation. Everyone is in a rush and we complete the dungeon without anyone saying a word unless it\u2019s someone raging because things aren\u2019t going perfectly.It\u2019s just different, but the way the game is made these days doesn\u2019t really encourage player interaction or cooperation as it once did. It\u2019s all about the rush and just to get things done as quickly as possible.Another huge thing is when sharding, phasing and CRZ aren\u2019t involved. Those things truly ruined server communities in my opinion. It was nice seeing the same people out in the world and in chat every day on your realm. It helped foster community. I don\u2019t know how many players BfA has, but I highly doubt it\u2019s as many as Vanilla had before BC launched. There were 8 million people playing before BC launched and there was ten times more of a server community than we have today.Unfortunately, Blizzard has decided to use a new tech in Classic for the launch period called layering. They have promised it would be removed in a few weeks. I could go on a long rant about that and my experience with layering in the stress test right now, but I will spare you lol. I will just say I hate it and leave it at that.",
                "Yeah I do miss that about vanilla, although it was aids to level and everything was slower paced it was great especially experiencing it the first time.Getting things done actually mattered. Now it\u2019s just the spoiled/entitled people expecting end game rewards for doing 30 minutes of world quests.As far as the community goes I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll change at all, like I said it\u2019ll be more of a forced cooperation to get things done.",
                "They\u2019ve been trashing BFA long before they were streaming the Classic beta. The current state of the game is why they are all excited for Classic in the first place. This is nothing new, other than the Classic beta.",
                "It\u2019s a change of pace and it\u2019s something newish, it\u2019s also nostalgia. Would you want to watch the same movie over and over or would you kill to have another option after a decade of the same.",
                "With all fo this said there is a lot of little things they can bring back to this game to make life easy for a lot of people, or rather greatly improve the quality of the game.Reforge systemMore enchantsAble to upgrade an item to a warforged, then to titan forged via dust or some other currencyMake sockets on items a fixed thing like it was in BC and wrath, none of this lol you got 2 sockets on all of your gear crap.That right there would make gearing in this game far more enjoyable as well.",
                "Personally I see a lot of complaining because they catered to the casual player in live and now with classic they won\u2019t get their way. It\u2019s going to take a lot more time/effort to get things done and acquire gear/achieves. Even the quality of life won\u2019t be there with all of the advancements they made over the years.Have fun reading your quests to decipher where to go next instead of having a dot on your map. Ok ok there may be an addon for that now but it was just an example.I was literally watching a streamer look for a quest turn in npc for 45 minutes the other day.",

                "I could care less what steamers think. Most post videos for shock value and to generate veiws, and not to rationally review a game.Some are balanced for sure, but I don\u2019t care at all. Especially since most of the streamers probably never even played classic wow. I have, and if they wanna go back to that dinosaur they can. While I appreciate the past and respect it, future is gonna keep coming, and a lot of the changes since classic have been for the better.I\u2019ve said this in other posts, but have fun racing back to trainers every time you level up in major cities to upgrade skills. You know, the thing that everyone now complains about with professions now having ranked recipies and levels. Now imagine that on every spell, attack and special ability in the game. Classic wow was more about fiddling over your character and min/maxing than it was about just getting out there and having some fun.But hey, that\u2019s me. Everyone else have fun, enjoy! There\u2019s a lot of good things about classic as well.",

                "It really is a lot different in that respect. I was in the stress tests, and I know some of the chat was trolling, but a lot of people were surprised that we didn\u2019t have this,  or we had to do that lol.I started in B.C. so I knew what it would be like, but I had forgotten some things, for me it was fun remembering, but I don\u2019t think it will be like that for everyone.",

I liked battlefield but it was more so a camping game than cod, at least in cod you didn\u2019t have to run a thousand miles to kill a camper.I tried some of the new fps but they were either too cartoon like \u201cfortnite etc.\u201d. I\u2019ve always liked strategy/fast paced but not futuristic fps games, and strategy games like age of empires/mythology etc. A buddy of mine from swedan gifted me a game, maybe I\u2019ll take a break and try to get my sleep cycle close to theirs to play that. Was like monster hunter or something else.",

What I see that I dislike is the low resource generation, low resource regeneration (mana), very high usage of potions (not that I hate potions, just many many MANY consumables).Frankly, the reason I am playing in BFA at all is the people. Perhaps the only reason I really play WoW is the people I have come to know. BFA could have a lot of things better but when it comes down to it many of us likely stay because of friends. This is what I think streamers bring, a way to unite people.I have no doubt Vanilla would still have its hype up, but if it was not for content creators/streamers I also have no doubt it would be far less hype. I remember several streamers doing BFA events with 100+ people trying to attend the events for either side (such as raiding capitols. I saw similar things on Vanilla streams.So do I think Classic is really that good? No. Do I think BFA is really that good? Hell no. However, its the people and streamers do a good job in spreading their opinions to like minded viewers which then spread further, etc etc. I believe streamers enjoy Vanilla because there are more things that force them together for the moment. There are no raids, no arena, and until recently there were no BGs.All the streamers were forced together because of the limitations, and I sincerely believe if they had all the 60 level content and PvP BGs we would see a slightly different story. I am sure the Beta would be good still, but it would be different and the attitudes would likely change. This is at least my view of the situation.",

(The old gods interest me, but coming so late in the expansion im already apathetic about the story.Gear progression doesnt matter because in 2-3 months a new patch will come out to reset everything, and catch up mechanics will be brought up to were you can get comparable gear or better to the last tier. I just don\u2019t see the point in doing a lot of hard work which will cease to matter in such a short time.On the topic of gear the fact that its a slot machine is infuriating. Do i get something actually useful? Did it titanforge? If i can\u2019t use it is it hopefully not an upgrade so i can give it away?Leveling feels hollow. There\u2019s no real danger, actually leveling up doesnt provide any rewards, while its neat that i can level wherever i want the fact that mobs level with me makes it feel like im never getting any stronger.I have a couple more gripes but im sitting at work and people are starting to stare XD",
                "BFA is not a high quality expansion. it is obvious that it not well thought out or executed compared to some of the better expansions. it feels like it was created on a shoestring budget.blizz deserves any and all criticism it is getting",
                "I mean are they really wrong?Classic is a superior game. BFA looks nice and everything, and it\u2019s great if all you want to do is raid, mythic+, arena/RBG, or collect stuff, but that\u2019s pretty much the extent of the game. The rest of it is of very little consequence.The economy sucks. Community doesn\u2019t really exist outside of guilds. Gearing feels like going to the casino. Classes don\u2019t feel very unique. Dungeon layouts are simple, and always easy to navigate (there is nothing that has ever come close to how awesome BFD was). Questing is boring; Click green eye to summon players who may as well be NPCs. Professions are shallow and designed in a vacuum.Blizzard refuses to remove awful features like LFD that were like a nuclear bomb to how the entire genre is played. There have been other solutions to the problems that people had with dungeoneering that should have replaced LFD -  Meeting stones, more viable tank/heal specs, the ability to swap specs at any time, gear stats that change with spec, most classes having some sort of cc option - Yet LFD remains as the solution. They clearly value LFD more than the social element that it destroyed. It is absolutely worthy of being called out as trash MMORPG design because it still exists despite a decade of the player-base pointing this out.Flex solves the original reason they splintered raids into multiple modes - yet we now have four modes. The path of least resistance used to also be the path of most resistance, and it felt epic. The problems with Classic were over-solved to the extent that BFA and Classic should be considered different genres.The current game is clearly not designed to be \u201cgame-play first\u201d  because the elements that made Classic great have been undermined year after year. It doesn\u2019t need to be hardcore, they could launch more accessible realms - it just needs to feel more like a world again.",

They are intentionally ignoring all the problems that plagued vanilla WoW, especially at the end game where there is absolutely nothing of value for non raiders to do. Where PvP was ridiculously one sided due to horrible class balance, horrible class design for classes like Paladin and Shaman (Paladins forced to heal in raids because their dps spec was crap and prot spec was vastly inferior to warrior), mage super duper squishiness, and raid gear basically let raiders one shot non raiders.Having downtime after every couple of mobs gets real old real fast. SO why they are praising having to sit down after every couple of mobs just because it\u2019s different from what we have now really gets me.

Realistically, racial bonuses and aesthetics won\u2019t encourage me to play an entirely new class; at best, I\u2019ll just race swap a toon if necessary.Part of it is that BfA\u2019s grinds are off-putting from an alt perspective.  If I don\u2019t like doing grinds on one toon, I won\u2019t enjoy them on another.  So, I simply won\u2019t play any new alts.

And all of those sources I\u2019m seeing were done about 6-8 months ago.TESO and FF14 are about to hit a new expansion, WoW has decidedly had  Very-bad to middling reception to their mid-xpansion game, particularly when content is being released more slowly.It\u2019s well within the realm of possibility that WoW is currently losing the race or on the brink of it, and when either of the other games gets their new xpac, they\u2019ll be behind.",

Otherwise you\u2019re looking at just 10% of people who tried it actually liked it.That said, account numbers aren\u2019t a relevant metric, but \u201chundreds of millions\u201d implies multiple hundreds, or well over a hundred million. 200 million would mean just 5% of people who played stuck around.

Its likely going to be more important that you compare gameplay and systems rather than cosmetics.In the end, i wouldnt stop a person from playing.

That, and my wife\u2019s also a leatherworker on her main, so there was basically no reason for us both to have it when she can make everything anyway. I made the Legion moose and the Draenor wolf for my collection, so I was basically done with everything I really wanted.",

It may also be more the standard timer-pay model, which is\u2026 slightly less awful, I\u2019ll admit.That said, if the sleazy casino model of video game monetization is choked off before that scathing disappointment is unleashed upon the world and they\u2019re forced to extensively retool the game, I\u2019ll be cackling like Baal.",

You earned gold by playing the game and completing daily quests.But the cost of that was displayed in its actual dollar value, and you could purchase any single thing you wanted.  No lootboxes, no random beyond what quest you got that day.That was, in my opinion, the best possible model for driving both sales and consumer friendly marketing of a F2P game.",

Doing silly things, coming up with unique game modes.  (We played a rush variant because we were in school and time limits were a thing. You could drop down as much mana as you had in your hand, and when you cleared your hand you drew a new hand.  Made for some\u2026 interesting deck builds.)But I never found joy in opening packs themselves, only annoyance at the packaging. Aside from playing the game I only had fun in redesigning decks and messing with mana-spell-monster ratios to build a specific advantage.  (My Red/Black deck was feared throughout the school as the ultimate crusher of dreams.)Digital card games?  Not so much fun.  They\u2019re constantly going through updates, you can\u2019t modify or hand-waive silly rules, there\u2019s none of the intense rules-lawyering that can cause hilarious debates and end up with \u201cWell fine then, if X is true, then I play Y, and now you are well and truly boned!\u201d  \u201cMeh, counter-spell, 6 mana charge.

You will get 500 for $10 or $20, when the price for a skin would be 850.Either way you will get scammed into buying a micro-transaction, or just over buying something that is worthless.Diablo Immortals will probably have something to that kind of thing, except it will be pay to win.Beside that, I really do not want the government in on this problem. The more government is in our games, the more control over it they will have.The best solution is to not fall prey or buy the stupid loot boxes.

Grinds are longer, items that cost farmable currency are more expensive, and most systems are designed around creating problems and selling you the solution. Its so obvious, and its ****ed. Devs have to actively hamper what would otherwise be a decent or great game in order to implement and \u201cjustify\u201d most MTX systems. I imagine games like newBattlefront 2 would have been at least half decent if not for these systems even being an idea. Further add the predatory nature of MTX systems like Lootboxes.On the otherhand, allowing government regulation is a pandora\u2019s box of issues. If we allow them their foot in the door with this, theres no telling how far theyd be able to go. Im worried issues like Video Game Violence might make a resurgence, and might not go so in our favor this time.Its a very conflicting issue.",

They honestly push that the item inside is not what you\u2019re paying for and its the entertainment of the excitement of the unknown about it that you are paying for\u2026thats text book Vegas entertainment gambling.Pay to win is staying. its paying to win or maybe not win thats under fire.",

No one likes to mention it in that light because people dont want to believe they aren\u2019t stupid. Vices have dropped empires to the ground. You can\u2019t let stupid have the run of the yard. So yes, just like people who drink and drive you have to stop stupid behavior before it does damage.And you have a good point. There is no game played with baseball cards but magic the gathering type card games will be subject to this as well\u2026",

I was hoping Shadowbringers would take us away from the Star Wars but without space storyline they were doing, but it\u2019s still super generic.They are actively dumbing down the one element that they had over WoW - the classes had more depth. Except Shadowbringers has done an amazing job of dumbing down the classes so much. I now have less buttons on my bar as RDM than before, despite gaining multiple new spells. It\u2019s just a bunch of \u201cIf X happens than Y ability becomes Z instead.\u201d WoW still needs to take a step back from all of this pruning its been doing, but Shadowbringers followed WoWs lead this expansion as far as class depth goes.Still a scripted PvE \u201cI like to fight dargons\u201d game only. Despite the multitude of issues that WoW has, it still has a solid PVP experience. The fluidity of combat and the ability to fight against the opposite faction instead of just following a scripted pve boss fight that you can memorize keeps that game in the gutter for me.WoW still captivates me - XIV only seems to captivate people that want to fight dargons only.",

Each expansion keeps feeling like an actual expansion, making the game bigger and better.WoW used to feel like that, but the last three expansions have felt more like contractions with all they keep taking away.Shadowbringers is really awesome.

                "GW2 is not a WoW clone and still manages to have a decent combat system. SWTOR is not a WoW clone and has a decent combat system. Having the worst combat out of all MMOs is a trait unique to XIV.Tell me when these classes actually \u201ckite\u201d. If the mob moves more than 20 ft from its spawn half the time it resets. Ive literally pulled mobs in XIV at max range and had them reset before they even could run to me. Most of the time ranged combat against mobs just comes down to how far i can initiate the fight from. I wont actually be moving, besides to get out of visible AoE marks, in fear of resetting the mob. If anything the combat seems reminiscent of Lineage.The core theme is the good guys fighting against the big bad oppressive empire, who has dark evil figures at the head of said empire.Cutting the ability bloat is part of the dumbing things down like WoW has been. Turning X ability into Y ability when Z situation occurs isn\u2019t ingenious class design. If WoW turned a bunch of abilities into other abilities would you think its great game design. \u201cWhen Frost mage procs Brain Freeze it turns Frostbolt into Ice Flurry. Such great and ingenious design, praise be XIV.\u201dWoW has been adding things like Warmode and Battle of Nazjatar. While those elements are in need of improvement, its still more enjoyable than sitting all days doing nothing in Ralgars Reach. While WoW pvp has left its prime, theres still an in depth curve for competing in random bgs, rated bgs, and arena. So while XIV has extremely limited options if you want to do something besides scripted pve, WoW has more options. Things to keep you engaged.Id argue that WoW has superior scripted PvE. Ive done savage content - its just memorizing a very rigid pattern. Something that can be memorized. While WoW pve isnt something super ingenious, it has a lot more randomness that needs to be accounted for, rather than just memorizing the DDR dance pattern.No thanks. Im not a fan of unresponsive combat, scripted pve killing dargons only game. I would not recommend",

                "Because the game isn\u2019t priced with the expectation a player will ACTUALLY play for a solid months worth of time. 15$ is NOT priced for 1 month of played time. It is priced for 1 month of access and they have data that tells them how much game time that really is on average.Let\u2019s say the average play time is 15 hours a week. That\u2019s 60 hours a month. Blizzard knows this and has determined that 60 hours of play time is worth = $15. That means they view the cost per hour as $0.25 an hour.Now let\u2019s say they swapped to making it a month of game time, without adjusting prices. Suddenly you are paying $15 for 720 hours of played time. That means you\u2019re paying $0.02 an hour. That is a MASSIVE drop in revenue. It would be monumentally stupid for any company to take this action.Now let\u2019s go back to where I said Blizzard has already, internally, decided what the cost per hour is. They have determined the cost to be $0.25 based on average play times. So if they went to an hourly model without losing revenue, you\u2019d be paying $180 for 1 month (720 hours) of game time. (However you\u2019d be paying the same as now if you play the average 15 hr a week).However this system comes with it\u2019s own challenges from the business end that could drive up costs or to incentivize designing addictive mechanics to keep people online. (You think it\u2019s bad NOW).Not to mention it financially punishes players for enjoying the game and wanting to play more, and really only benefits the players who aren\u2019t enjoying the game as much and therefore don\u2019t spend much time in it.",

Get deployed for 6 months, have to stay late at work, gotta cram for exams, moving and won\u2019t have internet, etc. As long as you aren\u2019t logged in you don\u2019t lose any of your prepaid play time.",

Also it was like $10 to add texting AND you only had 20 texts per month.  There was a women who came in crying a month after buying a phone because her phone bill was nearly $10000 (I kid you not).Also the OP is making the assumption that it would still be the same price if we paid for a month\u2019s worth of actual play time vs. a months worth of game access.",

                "I thought about that a long time ago but the way companies work it would probably cost the company. As of right now, if you play or you don\u2019t your sub is up in 30 days so you\u2019ll have to buy more time in 30 days. If you get an actual 30 days of in-game playtime then they lose money because some players log in maybe an hour or two a day.Player that logs in for two hours a day on a sub that works like you want then will spend $15 for about one year. Player that logs in for two hours a day buys current sub will spend $180 for a year. Blizz loses $165 per player like this. Companies don\u2019t survive like that.",

They did a poor job in QA, released a bad product, and got upset when they found out people figured out what they did wrong.They do not impose bans equally, they used a knee jerk reaction where none was needed. The easy fix would have to just been reduce the level to where they started and said don\u2019t do that again. This is EXACTLY what they did when Weekly Chests rewarded higher items than intended and people started using them.Folks knew the ilvl of those items was wonky but they equipped them anyway because they were in the weekly chest. Blizzard simply took the item away. No fuss , no muss. No bans necessaryThey could have applied the same logic here. Where were the bans for the pot debacle that crashed markets on server? There was none. No bans were needed.If you are going to employ a system of checks and balances, be consistent in how it is implemented.",
                "I think Blizzard did it on purpose to bait people. It worked.",
                "I am salty that a bunch of mouth breathers decided to cheat the system and got what I am working hard for little to no work.As for swapping mains, most stick to the forum user that people recognize.You may be in your 50\u2019s, i\u2019m shy of 40, obviously by all your post here that old adage with age comes wisdom doesn\u2019t really apply to everyone.",

                "I guess we will see by Monday when the first of the ban waves are over. Crossing my fingers though, getting a few day suspension and still getting the heritage armor will really make me angry.",

                "That seems to be the culture of these high end / world first guilds\u2026 exploit any bug, take any advantage, spend 1,000s in real life money to work around trade restrictions\u2026They may be talented players, but it\u2019s dirty play in my book.I had mild interest in the World first race\u2026 but the more I see of their culture of, honestly, boarderline cheating imo, the more I\u2019m turned off to the whole thing\u2026Sure, some of it\u2019s on Blizz for not testing these things. But this culture of screw fair play so I can down a boss first, or faster, or on a higher key, is disappointing.",

                "On this note i feel like the reasonable compromise would be a mandatory XP freezing buff instead of 31 day bans.Eye for an eye instead of punishing players for their silence.They had 3 days to reply the tweets that asked if the potion splitting was a bug. Complete radio silence. Nothing.Then suddenly bans.",

                "I think the bans are justified. I knew about the exploit yet I chose not to do it. If all they get is a 30 day ban, I have to admit I am a little pissed. All that experience should be rolled back too.  That\u2019s thousands of dollars in level boosts that people never paid to get their toons quickly leveled. Either that give the people who didnt cheat a couple free 120 boosts to level the playing field. I think its only fair if you don\u2019t plan doing a roll back. Just saying.",

No procs to rely on just a straight up steady rotation.To Ashnazg I picked a warrior because it was my first character made in wrath and dh didn\u2019t exist then lol",
                "You have chosen wisely.",
                "To be fair you really do sound like you\u2019ve made your choice. With that said, you can always count on a Hero Class to be better in most every way. Its why newer players tend to gravitate towards Hero and Pet Classes. Easy is safe.",
                "Because I don\u2019t want to play as an elf.",
                "Plate armor +MS. Also, who does love being decked out in plate?On another note though, I\u2019m not sure why they gave a ranged interrupt to the class with the highest mobility",
                "I play a warrior and have recently started working on a dh, seeing all of what dh has compared to my warrior made me ask this question. Rather frustrating I lack utility for as much damage or less even to them lol balance I guess?",
                "Its simplicity. You can\u2019t say that a class isn\u2019t easy when they are one of the TOP DPS classes with like 4 abilities. And if we go down the PvP route it gets even worse. Hero Classes are always a great choice no matter what. Doesn\u2019t mean you will always have a ton of fun, though.",
                "The biggest reason I went with Warrior over DH is I hate night elves.DPS wise DH is pretty much better in every way.  Better output, utility, and defensives.But I cant get over the night elf restriction.",
                "Plate seems to be our only redeeming quality atm haha as for mortal strike other classes such as Rogues have that and can make up for dh not having it so yeah idk if that\u2019s enough to say it\u2019s evenly balanced haha",

                "I am the Warrior.When you see me, I will, most likely, not be attired formally. I will be encased in my steel. It will be dirty, bloody, and battered. I do not have a quick tongue or eloquent speech. I know nothing of the manners of the King\u2019s court, or the ettiquette of the formal ball.I am known by many names. Tank. Meatshield. Fighter. Brawler. Corpse.I am the Warrior.I have not the capability, nor the inclination, to hide. I cannot strike from stealth with devastating blows, then fade into the darkness. I cannot incinerate a foe from twenty paces away. I cannot deal death from a distance, safe from the return attacks of my enemy. In order to kill, I must close with the enemy. I see his eyes. I smell his breath. I taste his fear. And he tastes mine.I cannot bend Nature to do my bidding. I cannot tap into the Nether and force it to do what I command. I cannot study the arcane and master it to my control. I command nought but my mind, my body, and my will. It is by those, and those alone, that I stand or fall.I have no friends on my journey. No walkers of the void, summoned from the Nether as servants and bodyguards. No loyal beasts of the plains or woods, to defend me and comfort me in my pain. My sole companion is my weapon. I must care for it better than any hunter has ever cared for his beast. I must master it more than any warlock has ever mastered his demon. Without me, it is useless. Without it, I am nothing.I cannot heal. I cannot shield. I cannot call upon the gods and see my prayers answered. I call to the spirits of my ancestors in the heat of battle, and they are silent. My only ability to protect is to offer myself, my blood and bone and sinew, as a sacrifice. To draw the attacks of our foes. To take the blows that would kill a lesser being, and continue to fight on.I cannot kill with the speed and grace of the rogue, the suddenness and shock of the hunter, or the flamboyance and power of the mage. When I kill, it is a slow business. Slow and bloody for all concerned, myself included. I fight on, pummeled and battered so that my companions may receive the glory of the kill and the wreaths of victory. If I die and they yet live, it is an expected sacrifice.I come in all races, all sizes. I fight under a thousand flags, on a million battlefields. I am dismissed by the highborn, scorned by the noble, lectured by the priest, and forgotten by the peasant. Until the time when the trumpets of battle sound, and those who would destroy them come forth. And then the cry goes up\u2026\u201cWhere, oh where, is the Warrior?\u201dPray to your gods that I continue to answer that call.Few do answer the call. Fewer still survive. It is a long and hard road, this way of the Warrior. Along it lie pain, and fear, and death. Scant rewards and scanter gratitude. At the end, for most, is an anonymous grave on some windblown battlefield. If they are lucky.And yet, I fight on. I do not even know why. Perhaps for glory, perhaps for fame, perhaps for money, perhaps for my country, perhaps for my family. Perhaps it is simply all I know how to do. But fight I will. Whether you appreciate it or not. Whether you even notice it or not. I will be out there, on the battle lines. Fighting. Killing. Dying.I am the Warrior.Death is my business.Be it yours\u2026or mine.",

                "For sure, I just wanted to bring that up as a general comparison.Truth me told? For some reason melee DPS and I don\u2019t jive. Of the two, though, I think I prefer the Warrior in stature and form. I\u2019ve never been fond of the swift hits of a small weapon (me and Rogue don\u2019t get along either for this reason) but seeing someone wielding massive, two handed weapons and the awesome new animations when you\u2019re cleaving down enemies, that is far more appealing to me.So perhaps visual preference over play style, even? Plate always looks powerful to me and I love the armor and weapons.",

                "Go on? Warriors have been regularly the lowest repped class for Mythic + for a long time and are considered the best tanks in the game right now. And you clearly don\u2019t watch the arena tournaments and/or participate in arenas.",
                "Yeah right now with balance as it is and their tool kits as they are it would seem that the warrior having plate as it\u2019s armor type is it\u2019s only advantage over dh and that\u2019s just in terms of looks not survivability haha. In wpvp I can do massive damage on my warrior don\u2019t get me wrong but I was literally 1v3ing some 120 hordes as my dh today with little experience it\u2019s very sad to me lol",
                "I never understand these threads. Classes have their strengths and weaknesses. Every spec has participation in PVE and PVP. Pick it because you want to play it. I don\u2019t get it\u2026",
                "As of right now you wouldnt take fury over havoc. Havoc is just to damn good in everything but that\u2019s the nature of the game, dont worry eventually with buffs an nerfs fury will be above havoc an so on an the cycle will continue.",
                "I main a DH and leveled a HM Tauren warrior, and it was by far the most fun I had leveling of any of my 12 alts.  Half prot, half fury, and I still enjoy it, more so than my monk.  So have fun with both I say.  ",
                "Maybe it\u2019s your familiarity with Warrior that helped you learn Havoc, and that\u2019s why you were able to do that with little experience?I have my bars set up so that certain things are universal across all specs; interrupt is always on 9, filler spells are 1, 3, 4, etc. And the resource spending are all on 2, for example. So when you have two specs that are fairly similar (take Afflock and Shadow Priest, for example) you find similar spells on the same keys. There may be a small variation, but for the most part you\u2019re able to play the character with some degree of success based on you knowing the spec it is similar to.Just my two cents, class/spec preference is a fun conversation because everyone has different tastes!",
                "Warrior players usually have 5 more brain cells than demon hunters",
                "Yeah I\u2019m the same way. I put my interrupts stuns etc on the same keybinds when possible that could explain it, but honestly it just feels like dh is stronger overall.",
                "DHs can\u2019t go sword/board or swing a mighty 2H.  Plus they\u2019re fairly geeky looking to me.  That\u2019s all I need for reasons.",
                "If you would have read the thread it would give you some insight as to why the question was asked?",
                "Depends on the player. We have an Arms Warrior (despite being an underperforming spec) who absolutely destroys the charts in our Heroic group because he puts that much effort into his character.Consequently, we have a DH who can\u2019t even beat our Prot Paladin some nights.Player skill comes before actual spec performance, imo.",
                "I think warrior needs more than buffs to be wanted over dh tbh. Like I mentioned before it\u2019s not just damage it\u2019s utility that dh wins out on as well.",
                "An it will happen, maybe not this xpac but eventually, it\u2019s a cycle you got some classes being top right now then later on other classes will be top an so on.But honestly unless you are pushing world first or doing plus 15 keys an above it really doesnt matter every class is completely viable",
                "Yeah I whole heartily agree with that at a normal/heroic level of play, but when you start pushing mythic and people know what they are doing do you bring the class with no utility or the one with utility?",
                "Warriors can output some serious DPS as a tank. But I always consider a DH better than a warrior.",
                "Having 5 extra brain cells doesn\u2019t really mean anything if they are dead brain cells.",
                "I\u2019m not arguing fun factor here yeah I find both fun and enjoyable I just mean overall tools like why are dh the most mobile in the game with a baseline aoe stun, a purge, range kick, and 2 def CDs all baseline? When my warrior has what\u2026 1 charge baseline and commanding shout? Haha",
                "Well said, brother.",
                "Well let\u2019s see.DH provides extra magic damage and Darkness. Warrior brings Rallying Cry and Battle Shout. So they bring equal utility?So the question comes down to are you running more melee or casters? In the current raid, I think it\u2019s a relatively even split (though I do recognize the top 1% had more casters, hence the token Mage and DH, though they did supplement that with a Warrior tank).But yeah, we are a melee heavy comp with only a few casters, so a Warrior is far more beneficial to us than a DH if we had to choose.",
                "Aoe stun and purge as well can\u2019t forget lol all that baseline. Oh yeah darkness too! Lol",
                "Shield Slam. I love whonking things in the face with a shield.There\u2019s a pirate! SHPTANGGGK!Look out for that witch! &lt; reflect spell in witch\u2019s face. then hit them in face with shield &gt;It is funny to me.",
                "Fury and Havoc are pretty equal in a raid setting.  In M+ though, oh boy, Havoc is busted as hell.",
                "Well, I was thinking utility that was more universal. You won\u2019t be using a Purge very often, just like you wouldn\u2019t be using the healing reduction in Mortal Strike if you had an Arms Warrior, But there are bosses where those abilities come in use.The AoE stun can be supplemented by racials that DHs don\u2019t have any access to. Which gives Warriors a lot of variety.",
                "Still got execute and an aoe snare (mechatorque bots!!!), plus self heals that Havoc doesn\u2019t have unless it\u2019s in meta via leach, and overall more health as Fury.  Plus shout is amazing.  So utility ads flavor and warrior is tasty.",
                "Because at the end of the day, you still have to look at yourself in the mirror, that\u2019s why.",
                "whats the point of savin the world if i dont look good while doin it right?",
                "demon hunters are the meta right now and there are a lot of them.",
                "That has to be the best explanation of a class ever! I don\u2019t play warriors very often but that still sounded bad@ss!",
                "There\u2019s a very severe tradeoff for that damage\u2026 you have to be a pretty elf, eww.",
                "To play a viable tank.",
                "No reason to, DH&gt;warrior. We have the best mobility, a simple rotation that keeps us high on DPS charts, decent CC, and a 2nd form that lets us do a lot of damage.DH isn\u2019t for everyone thought, just like how I can\u2019t really get into warrior - your mobility is \u201cOK\u201d but not great, damage is ok but rotation isn\u2019t too complex either but not fun to me either, having to slowly build up your rage bar slower then we build up fury.",
                "Because as much fun as I think DH are I find warriors to be more fun.",
                "Why not play both? I have a belf dh that I really like, and I have this warrior that I really like. So, I play both. Best of both worlds.",
                "thats got nothing to do with the question at hand though. if you were a raid leader and had 1 melee spot open, why would you take a warrior over a dh when a dh has more dmg, more mobility, and more utility?",
                "we\u2019re very much just a bad havoc but fury is still no slouch in m+, especially this week.it has amazing sustained cleave that is fun to play. DH will probably beat you on reaping if they get to eyebeam before you bladestorm but we have fine, consistent damage because our cooldowns come back very soon.A DH can blow their CDs and delete the first reaping in the second boss room of UR, but a warrior can pull 30k+ dps easy on all the trash packs of that room if they are big enough; that\u2019s where we shine.arms this week is probably a ton of fun with test of might. most trash will survive the extended window and probably live long enough to be hit by another war breaker. a tank pulling with your test of might buff still up is a good tank.",
                "Why be an elf when you can be a dwarf or orc or troll or undead\u2026you get the point.",

            "init_post": "Worgen MonksIntroduction:With patch 8.25 Worgen are getting model updates. And this is an opportunity to also correct a mistake from the past. That mistake is, not having worgen monks.Justification:Much like how worgen druids start as harvest witches and then become druids, I feel worgens can start as brawlers (after all Queens rules boxing aka modern boxing was invented in England) and become monks via the wall collapse and meeting a pandaren (just a random trainer in the second village players enter). This is also supported by Darius Crowley being a brawler during the prison break. He literally beats down alpha worgen with his hands and a stick.Counter Claims: This has never made sense due to both Bloodelf and Draenei starting zone also being time locked but their monk trainers have been added after the fact. Some people falsely claim those zones have been updated but this is sadly not true. In the Draenei zone for instance the monk trainer \u201cMojo Stormstout\u201d is quoted as saying \u201cI\u2019m just walking along, when suddenly\u2026BAM mimcks and explosion with his hands when the exodar crashed\u201d. Monks officially have be retconned into Draenei lore from the start.h ttps://wow.gamepedia.com/Mojo_StormstoutThe same thing occurs with \u201cPao\u201d for the blood elf\u2019s. A retcon to make monks possible for those time locked zones.The monk animations do not work on worgen models. The thing is anyone who knows about rigging a model can quickly tell you that 8 bit Mario can even be set up to do monk animations. Besides the work is already done in game. Just us an image swap or a potion of illusion into a worgen and see for yourself. Not to mention anyone can use in game file model viewer to see for themselves.h ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3j_KObvj18This is countered by the quests for becoming a worgen. You literally have to finish the quest that makes you at peace with yourself. You control the beast. The only reason in lore that you turn into a worgen is because the form is superior in combat vs a human body. This is to make you (the worgen) more combat effective.The quest \u201cneither human nor beast\u201d literally says \u201cDrink from the waters of Tal\u2019doren and make peace with yourself\u201d as a reward you gain mastery over the beast and change on command. No longer a raging beast.h ttps://www.wowhead.com/quest=24593/neither-human-nor-beastAgain this is not true. Monks are balanced. They are both good and bad. Light and Dark. Good and Evil. And in equal parts. In the closed testing for MoP monks we had 2 dark chi and 2 light chi and we had to maintain balance with them to use our moves. Black out kick (dark chi) Rising Sun kick (light chi) etc. This was dropped for a more practical system we have today but the names where kept to remind all monks we are both dark and light chi\u2026 we are balance.Fast forward to 35minutes and 22 secondsh ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVSiFXI0FH0In closing we can all agree this is an opportunity for more player choice. Wrogen and Goblin monks should have always been possible and this new update with heritage armour is a chance to make that happen.",

The first patch on ptr went everywhere to the constant changes made to make alliance happy to some degree. Failed at it complettly despit 5 rewrites.The current war chief went from ok at the beginning to Saturday morning cartoon villain next patch to know one Knowes because they keep changing her. That is due to a large amount of the ones who post are doing it from a book. It kind of messes up the game. Where writing went horrible to just incomprehensible. That main reason the support Baine they ignore all bad things he has done in the game. Only look at the good things he has done in the book. Saying books trump in-game lore. Well, might work for them.People often quote books here. They seem to not understand not everyone in game players read wow books or patch notes for that matter. They go off what in game. That leads to a host of confusions. As they post stuff from the book that never happens in the game as proof. This leads them to ignore anything in the game.

Were we went to alliance for help when we had the majority of horde supporting getting rid of Hellscream. Why did we need alliance help. Is horde so week that all other races could not beat the orcs. Why thrall allowing us to get their help. Once again in BFA. It just wrong. One thing I am tired of. All the traitor in horde. Why they in the horde if they prefer the allince help over their own members.What he and others did is treason and what other leaders are doing is treason.

Otherwise, it\u2019ll probably be as disappointing as the last 3 and then look better in retrospect as the following expansion is even worse.I really think they need to look backwards for ideas, not try and reinvent the game every expansion.

They lack the vision and the ability to think big and to do more beyond the hamster wheel, metric padding timesinks we\u2019ve seen multiple iterations of since wod.The other factor in this: as you\u2019ve said, they don\u2019t ever admit they\u2019ve made a mistake, or scrap a bad system\u2026they just tinker with it.

You will be able to level up from 1 to max entirely in them, with some few zones for low levels and most zones for high level. You can visit the original continents or past expansions, but only if you wish.The work done in Arathi, Darkshore, Uther\u2019s Tomb and Lordaeron are partly due to cut costs, as they help the team see how their new zones would look like.Also, the longer period between patches in BfA is so the team is able to do the massive work on new Kalimdor and EK.The game will be fresh and ready for new players.That\u2019s my bet.",

I can\u2019t really shake how the initial reaction of all the content that came at the start of the expansion. It would take a massive announcement for me to reconsider playing BFA.",
                "I find that ita very unlikely for truely large open world MMORPGs to happen without letting there be huge expanses of rather empty uninteresting landscape. MoP onwards, they have focused more on compact landscaping, putting quest zones close to each other with slightly denser mob spawns, make it easier to get around to your desired location, but it came at a cost of making everything feel small.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wrong decision, but the way the playerbase looks and feels, it gives the wrong impression though its fine. Like for example, how many alliance players actually like voldun? It\u2019s a huge empty space with almost nothing for them to do, that\u2019s a kind of design direction you\u2019re seemingly wanting the game to put everyone in? In contrast to say suramar of legion, where you have almost no wasted space, everything is packed brimming with activities or danger (while questing/exploring)",
                "I like your optimism but I\u2019m still skeptical. 8.2 is definitely a step in the right direction though, Essences are awesome and the benthic gear system is finally a gear system without RNG, just go get currency and plan out your upgrades. These two systems alone make 8.2 very appealing for me. Mechagon being a new timeless isle is also very appealing, I loved timeless isle from the rares to the exploration to the rep grind and mechagon is looking good.I wanna see what happens with class design, talents, new abilities, etc. I wanna see what kind of content they\u2019ll have in the next expac for people that don\u2019t do raiding. Islands and warfronts are pretty horrible and don\u2019t cut it as end game content, they\u2019re both unengaging. There\u2019s a lot that I still need to see to determine whether or not I\u2019ll continue next expac."

Would it drastically ruin the balance Blizzard is going for?  Would the world end if players were happier to get key pieces of loot without having to endlessly grind week after week after week after week?Because when it comes down to it, what\u2019s the point of the game?  In my view, it\u2019s to learn the fight, master the fight, and progress.  The story is great, too.   The point of the game shouldn\u2019t be to endlessly kill the same boss in the hopes, maybe, someday, if I\u2019m lucky, to get A (singular) loot drop.Bonus Coins already cost too much.  You can only get two per week.  The problem is that, more often than not, I only get AP when I bonus roll on a raid boss or world boss.  That\u2019s ridiculous and actively discourages me from playing the game.Blizzard, can you change this?",

Sending lowbies to low level BGs for marks sounds like a headache inducing mess.Not really using them except for purple bosses if I don\u2019t get something.  One loot is enough per week.  I\u2019m not greedy (for things to disenchant).",

Plus the sockets, Enchants, armor kits, etc that gave you additional control over your characters stats.While the new system is def more casual friendly there are some rather glaring downsides to it.",

I mean, companies have limited control as to what players do with their files and games. So they should not have to have responsibility and be penalized by the ESRB over it.Think of it this way - it is like if you own a store and someone commits a crime on your property - the store owner should not get penalized as a result.

Even then that is a stretch since unless I am wrong, blizzard does not put a seal of approval of any kind on any addons, they simply allow them to exist and function until they find out about one they don\u2019t like.I really think we have just become attached to addons and thus don\u2019t want to catagorize them in the same way as something deemed against the TOS.

These limitations are actually extremely limited as far as modding communities are concerned.It wouldn\u2019t take much work for Blizzard to add certain model and texture file paths to the list for allowed modification while leaving the more abusable paths restricted. Doing so would allow for the harmless mods to be created and used without compromising the integrity of the system.As things are currently, and have been for a while now, modders have to crack the .exe and enable a flag to accept all client-side modifications. This has the adverse effect of creating an opening for malicious hacks and botting programs. If the need for such cracks were removed, then multiple things would occur.Firstly, the individuals who create and maintain the crack for the .exe every patch would have no real reason to continue to maintain it. I can assure you 100% that the guys who maintain the crack don\u2019t want to aid in the creation of bots and hacks. They only want to allow for harmless mods, and if a system were in place to allow for exactly that, they would be more than happy to cease all updates on their cracks. I happen to know for a fact that one of them actually approached blizzard about doing exactly that back during WoD. They quite obviously weren\u2019t met with support from Blizzard on the topic, but they also weren\u2019t met with hostility either.The second result would be an increase in the number and quality of mods. The reason why games like Elder Scrolls and Fallout have such high volume of mods is because the developers actually support the existence of mods. To some, this may not sound like a good result, but it actually is. With an increase in quantity and quality of mods, there is also an increase in interest to the game. Many people are actually drawn to games by mods, and many veterans only remain because of mods. Mods allow for the community to add things to the world in a harmless way. There are mods currently that if they were supported would actually cut back on some of the negativity within the community by allowing individuals who want to play as certain races a way to do so by reskinning existing playable races (or model swapping them in some cases)\u2026 it also provides an avenue for those who wish certain races weren\u2019t in the game.As for the arguments about collision detection\u2026 if you are changing map and world elements, then yes, you manipulate the collision detection in a harmful way that allows for bypassing gates. Modification of those model elements should always remain locked. However, the collision detection on player models is actually a bit more complex. I\u2019ve seen the results of modders attempting to rescale player models from WoD, and their collision boxes didn\u2019t scale with the model. Model swapping to small creatures often results in an enlarged model with a collision box the same size as the original as well. If people were swapping feral form with tiny cats in BC to bypass gates, then Blizzard has clearly taken steps to prevent that since then. I\u2019ve never heard of people swapping the playable models for this though, I did hear of people replacing the crates near the gate, to give them a way to jump over, and replacing the gate itself, to allow them to just walk through unhindered, though.",

Plus it isn\u2019t just making flags bigger, they can make racial models different making them easier to spot.  How would they know the difference between an innocent model change and one done to give the player and advantage?",
                "Yes. It has also been mentioned that model changing can also change the hitboxes of models. This right off the bat can give some people huge advantages in all kinds of situations, even if they aren\u2019t trying to do it for this reason. I just simply won\u2019t do it altogether.",

It was fun and I could apply my brain to get good gear and compete. There was a certain amount of grinding going on but nothing like the end game raids and dungeons and the PVP at top level. After discovering twinking I had a new reason to keep playing and I did. I played Wow since its inception.Then Blizzard made took away normal battlegrounds from twinks. Now there was no one to play with. Ques were impossibly long and just non existent. With the advent of that new rule I lost all interest in Wow. I let it go, even though I had two accounts and about 40 characters on various servers.This was about five or six years ago. I played on a lot of free servers and it was fun but none really satisfied. Then my son told me that Wow really changed and I should take a look. So, I opened up one of my accounts and I discovered that twinking was not only back, but alive and well. And it was equally balanced. There were just as many horde twinks as alliance. We win some and lose some, but it was always exciting and fun. I opened up my other account and started a third account after I discovered the 110 bracket of twinking, which I had not heard of previously.I discovered a vibrant community of 110 twinks, all supportive and fun and it was funny because we generally spent a whole lot more time working on better gear than actually playing BGs. I don\u2019t know our actual number but we would have 15-30 guys on at any given time.Then Blizzard did it again, giving such a lame excuse, something like \u2018this is what it was like before.\u2019 Now, as a while back, twinks can only compete with twinks which literally means we cannot do BGs anymore.Our once thriving community is dead. Twice in the past 4 days I have logged on and was the only one on. That never happened before. I see a few people in the day but no more organized events, raids, or BGs. Just dead. Its sad really.I don\u2019t know who at Blizzard made this decision. It was a bad decision before and it is just as bad now. I have one question: Have people quit playing Wow because there were twinks in the battlegrounds? I really don\u2019t know but I guess not. And I do know a lot of people, including myself, who are quitting over this stupid decision. I imagine they felt so bad about it is the reason they never announced it. Didn\u2019t have the guts to come out and say it.People whine about twinks a lot. And I guess there are some twink people who are just mean. But not most of us. And honestly, you will win as much and lose as many games with or without twinks. Even though our 110 community would show up with a 5-man BG group, there were plenty of times that the 5-man horde twink group just devastated us. In the end, it doesn\u2019t give anyone an edge either way. But for me personally, it was the most fun I ever had playing Wow.My 3 accounts are all unsubscribed now. This is after spending at least $300 in the past year leveling up toons to 110 to begin the process of gearing up for BGs. it could have been more actually. One account is down and one is not being played. The 3rd account stops in 5 days. I know of a lot of other players, from other twink communities, who are quitting. I guess this is what Blizzard wants.They never gave any good reason for this decision. It was lame at best and did not make any sense. The only way I will come back is if they reverse this. They did before so perhaps they will again.I know Bliz can\u2019t make everyone happy. I guess they are doing their best.",

There is a TON of new content, WAY more than there was in 7.2 and really more than any other \u201c.2\u201d patch I can remember. There are tons of new things to do and the entire experience is pretty fun.I\u2019ll admit that the faction imbalance in Nazjatar makes Warmode difficult and sometimes even painful, but that\u2019s really the only gripe I have.Also, Benthic gear and the manapearls are a great improvement over Argunite back in Legion, and I am LOVING the new Essence system so far.Sure, the patch isn\u2019t perfect (no patch has ever been perfect), but it\u2019s been fun, and I don\u2019t understand where all this negativity is coming from.

There was about 10-15 horde member on every single rare mob I ran into, took me over 6 hours to find and kill 3 rares with WM on.I know I should of just turned it off and attempted somewhere else, especially since I was getting mobbed any time I did happen upon one. But I\u2019m pretty darn stubborn and really want to keep it on. I\u2019ll see how long I keep that mindset if I keep getting that unlucky.Otherwise I enjoy 8.2 and no complaints\u2026 Just please no more dailies requiring 3 rares.",

Ion had a whole video about the ways Blizz realizes they messed up. But because of how the design structure of this game works, many of those fundamental issues simply can\u2019t be solved until the next expansion rolls around.8.2 does what it can within the infrastructure that is Battle for Azeroth, but there was never a possibility that it would be able to fix all the problems with the game. Big things like class design, Azerite armor, and stuff like that won\u2019t be able to be fixed until 9.0 rolls around. It\u2019s sad, but true.",

                "I was expecting more story wise for the zone like a Suramar 2.0 for Nazjatar. It\u2019s not like Azshara is a major WoW villain or an important character to the lore. I was expecting more when it came to the story, and also more from my Elven compatriots, since ya know this was a PRETTY BIG DEAL for them. (Let\u2019s also ignore the fact that two important elves on the Alliance aren\u2019t even involved in the zone that had a lot to do with the Sundering and Azshara, but we\u2019ll have dogboy there instead.) So, being a lore junkie, this zone and Mechagon have fallen flat.Let alone the \u201cepic battle\u201d of Nazjatar is a mouse fart in comparison to BC, Wrath, or Cata where at least the world PvP had meaning to WHY you\u2019d fight over a zone.Lastly the amount of time gating and grinding required is down right abysmal, and not just for flying, factions, or Benthic gear, but also for Essences. Don\u2019t even get me started on how I feel about doing this on an alt.I\u2019d like to add, Blizzard shot themselves in the foot when they also hyped this up, which then the community hyped up, and then it wasn\u2019t what the hype was hyping about.",

Its not fun when you are working on rep farming and 90% of the starfish despawn due to phasing, its not fun when half of the rares don\u2019t count for the quest, its not fun when you have to log off halfway through the gnome heritage quest because the item your supposed to interact with is uninteractable unless you log off and back on.This patch doesn\u2019t fix BFA\u2019s core problems, but I believe its decent enough\u2026for now\u2026but the sheer quantity of game breaking bugs has been astounding.",

Anything else will probably get upgraded with the new raid.  Meanwhile, the alt that has my profs on it and actually could use the gear upgrades doesn\u2019t get much time out there because I\u2019m rep grinding on my main.  The good news is that my priest alt will have it a bit easier in about another week or so when I\u2019m done with rep and have flying.And the bugginess drives me insane.  Not getting credit for killing rares and quest items phasing out just as you\u2019re about to collect them.",

Not all of it and there are some good and positive feedback about what they can change and etc.  I tend to take any negative stuff people complain about with a grain of salt because most of the complainers just sit on the forums and look for stuff to post about to make conversation with others to complain about Blizzard is doing wrong while the people who are enjoying the game and not complaining are playing the game and don\u2019t have time to come on the forums because they are enjoying the game.",

Unhappy people post, a lot.  I read forums rarely, usually to see if an in-game problem I\u2019m seeing is common amongst other players.  It is a depressing place to be.  My advice is to keep your visits brief.  And always take a hot shower after reading them.",
                "Yeah. Blizzard\u2019s working on it, slowly and steadily all of the issues I\u2019m having are disappearing.The jellies being incredibly tedious has been fixed, but I still had to suffer through it once.The Bejeweled WQ has been fixed (the old \u201cLine 5 up at once\u201d optimal strategy was to continuously reset the WQ until you got it handed to you\u2026which is pretty bad design IMO)Can\u2019t say if the Heritage quest has been fixed or not, only did it once.Also can\u2019t say if the starfish has been fixed or not.Blizzard just tweeted that they are fixing three issues with RaresHowever, there are still some problems I have with Nazjatar quests that have yet to be addressed (and I doubt they will).The bounty quests, such as \"Slay 25 X\u2019s, don\u2019t have any indicator of where you need to go to find these enemies - now, I\u2019m fine without there being a map icon, but they don\u2019t even give you directions in the quest text. Let the quest text be useful for once and give hints on where the mobs are.Same could be said with the Collect X quests. They don\u2019t give any indication, not even in the quest text.Frankly, for both of those, its incredibly tedious - and unfun - to tab out to wowhead to find where to go, when a simple line in the quest text is all you need. Its one thing if you can find these mobs/items scattered through the zone, but instead they are all clustered in their allocated area. This doesn\u2019t foster exploration, it fosters tabbing out to google the answer.There\u2019s a lot of little things that all add up to big things due to the bugs. First impressions are everything, and if the first impression is bad, chances are even after the bugs are ironed out, one\u2019s feelings for the zone won\u2019t change all too much.",

I didn\u2019t mind questing in Kul Tiras and got all my factions to max, but I dislike Nazjatar enough that I don\u2019t see myself grinding out what is needed.I really enjoy Mechagon.  I like the quests and the layout.  I will spend some time there, but as soon as I finish the story, I\u2019m done until 8.2.5 or 8.3 drops.",

Most of my time spent on other games at the moment is more to play with other people as opposed to simply not being motivated to play WoW.",
                "Personally I find it extremely boring to do repetitive daily quests, and the world quests they put in are OK at best, but in mecha there is only one world quest per day that gives 850 rep, and there are only 2 of them (kill 3 rare spawns, or run around and collect treasure.) As much as I keep logging on and trying to get into this patch, I find myself unable to care about any of these beautiful new zones we were given. There could be so much stuff in mecha that they simply didn\u2019t put in (You have an endless font of technology\u2026 use it)Also I\u2019ve found myself thinking \u201cI\u2019m grinding new rep (which is cut off to about 1000 rep max per day without running around farming rare spawns) so I can fly, so I don\u2019t have to grind rep anymore\u201d when I\u2019m not even going to play after I get flying because I\u2019ve done my rep grind.

Folks insisted the nightborne were technically a new model because they have different idle/running animations, while the alliance got shafted with a reskin nobody asked for or wanted. It would definitely happen again with a gnome reskin.",

All the allied races are just different versions of existing races. Kul Tirans have entirely new models but they\u2019re still humans, Zandalari are still trolls, the Mag\u2019har are still orcs, etc\u2026 Vulpera are a brand new race and should be treated as such if they add then in the game.All that said I would play Vulpera in a heartbeat if they are added to the game.

Even our beast race are humans.The only exception to this is Draenei.I imagine we\u2019ll get the Junker Gnomes and Horde will get Vulpera. That is currently what all signs point to.Though, I\u2019d welcome being wrong if it means us getting Sneks. They look really cool.I just doubt it is all.",

If they even do it I take anything they say at half value cause thats what we usually get from them.",

Horde would get a unique skin/race for the goblin model and alliance would get gnomes with pieces of junk for limbs?  NO THANKS.I love gnomes.  I would accept gnomes untainted by the curse of flesh with approval from mimiron.",

They need something new and exciting to pull people back in, or to get some horde players to try out the blue team. Junker-gnomes, especially when compared to vulpera, is not going to turn any heads.",

And Goblins having Giblens.Who knows what Worgens and Forsakens will have (I bet they will come out opposite to each other). And Pandas will be released alone or something.",
                "It is very unlikely there will be an allied races until the prepunch of next expansion. Last expansion, there was only 4 released. So far there have been 4 released and non of been officially announced.

Keep in mind:There is also an Ogre icon found in that beerfest datamining thing. This is most likely a holiday event thing that happens in Voldun.There are Gilgoblin male and female racial icons found plus a Gilgoblin female model and the goblin model updates are planned for 8.2.5. Historically when player models get updated, it extends to npcs.Reminder. No official confirmation on that stuff.",

                "Okay so I just checked with my friend in the goblin discord who brought up the Ogre icons. I got the context wrong. Basically it is this. For brewfest there is a number of racial mug icons for a number of new playable races. However there is also one for Ogres.Brewfest, based on Oktoberfest, is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest! Players can acquire the Brewmaster title, mounts, toys and more.And ogres aren\u2019t playable. So basically what this means is that the Vulpera icon is most likely indicative of a holiday event, but not that they will become and allied race.",

That is most likely what the Vulpera icon stands for. A temporary holiday event, but I wouldn\u2019t consider it evidence or suggestive that they will become playable.",

                "Vulpera better be neutralEnough with grind fests, the horde or alliance is a artificial block, there is no reason to not make it neutral unless once again it goes to horde and they get a cool small fur race while alliance again gets the middle finger and more gnomes with a leg reskinEnough of this horde only or alliance only, all new races should be neutral",
                "Why would they be neutral?  What about their story and relationship with the Zandalari, Horde, and Alliance would suggest Vulpera would be a neutral race?  Its not like the Alliance had to go farm up rep with them or anything, and MechaGnomes are looking to be solidly designed.They have neat customization options, intriguing lore, a cool civilization (built completely independently from the Gnome\u2019s of Gnomergon), and have a Zone+Megadungeon devoted to backing up those things.  They also have the potential to augment the lore of the CORE Gnome race.The only real thing working against them is \u2026 they\u2019re Gnomes.  Which, tbh, shouldn\u2019t be an issue if you realize that Aesthetics isn\u2019t the only thing that makes an Allied Race good.  This is the reason Void Elves are subjectively the worst Allied Race atm, as they truly are devoid of tangible lore (and will likely have to depend on future content dealing with Old Gods/Void to get it).",
                "Yes, we go to Nazjatar \u2026 and we help a collection of slave races there.  It is not exclusively GilGoblins, and tbh \u2026 we know very little about their presence or relevance in the plot there yet.  We\u2019ve gotten very little about that zone datamined, due to it not really being on the PTR.  They may just be a vehicle for the Naga centered storyline there \u2026 they may be something more.IMO, Vulpera and GilGoblins could both be in the running for the Goblin Allied race slot; but Vulpera currently have the edge.  Naz\u2019jatar could change this \u2026 or it could reinforce their status as a NPC race; we\u2019ll have to wait and see.  That being said \u2026 I\u2019m not opposed to Gil\u2019s being an Allied Race IF the work to fix their issues is dealt with (and there biggest issues are culture and civilization atm).Can you say the same about Vulpera?  If they take that slot (which is a possibility whether you want to admit it or not) \u2026 would you be OK with that?",
                "Gilgoblins need a lot more than just a zone, they need everything, including intelligence.",
                "It is worth noting that intelligence isn\u2019t necessarily a requirement. They could be could be goblins that have a bit more of a magical affinity while still retaining their hustler nature.",

We know that the Unshackled are going to be a combination of species, and while its pretty easy to guess that we\u2019re bound to get at least ONE Gilblin Ally; and Makrura and Sea Giants will be just as much a part of that faction as the Gilblins.

And while it is true that Vulpera have had a lot of work done on them, there have also been many npcs that have had lots of work done on them too that never become playable. There is also the highly speculated mechagnomes which seem to be following the same pattern. Not to mention. We don\u2019t have an aquatic race right now and mechagnomes would be a new machine race. Both are the result of taking racial professions(Mekkengineering and Alchemy) to the extremes. So if both were released together, then they would both be entirely new racial themes.

People aren\u2019t giving Gilgoblin enough credit. Just imagine if these things can be druids. What if they update their models with bioluminescent hair? What if they really nicely flesh out the lore for them. Plus Gilgoblin shamans would look way cool. I know these are a lot of what if\u2019s but I am just saying. They really could be a nice race if done right.",

If you become a mechagnome, you cannot be a druid. If you become a druid, you can\u2019t be a tinker. If you become both, you are something entirely new altogether. A bioengineer. Now a tinker class with special mecha forms would be nice though.Now mechagnome paladins though. These would make more sense since it has been shown from the blood elves that the light is a force that can be manipulated and controlled by anyone.",

There are even fewer goblin players than there are gnome players at max level and that says something when goblins actually have useful racials.  An even uglier goblin is going to be an addition enjoyed by not even a percent of the population, and mechagnomes already disappoint me in that regard.

As the honorary flying...just after \u201cparticipant 33\u201d : So essentially, there is an interesting aspect to that question. So these are allied races. These are not subraces. There is no direct associated race or parent race, or anything like that.

The same way we would with any new race that we are be adding into the game.\u2013\u2026so initially, the plan wasn\u2019t that they had to have a strict parent race. that idea may have changed, but if it has, Blizzard hasn\u2019t made their stance clear about it.
